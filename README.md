# aquaDRAMA

A monitor and various pieces that I use on my saltwater tank.
  * Monitor - a board with probes that sends data to https://thinger.io
  * Status "roller" which polls https://thinger.io to show status

## Hardware

  * Arduino MKR1000 WIFI
  * Shield adapter
  * Probe Shield from Atlas
  * Probes and "chips" from Atlas
  * need to find the source of the roller board (ebay...)
